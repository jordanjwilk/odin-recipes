    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mashed Pototoes are wonderful. Can't argue this. Now add some spice
        and you've entered an entirely different realm. Wasabi, typically 
        put on sushi is a great additive to mashed pototoes. Especially 
        if you are paring the dish with a Seared Ahi dish.</p>
    
    <p>Making wasabi mashed potatoes isn't all that different from
        your typical mashed potatoes. Same style, only you add wasabi
        at the end. Easy enough.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 medium sized gold potatoes</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Wasabi Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and cut potatoes into small pieces</li>
        <li>Boil potatoes until soft</li>
        <li>Mash potatoes with large flat spoon</li>
        <li>Put wasabi powder into small bowl with a little water</li>
        <li>Mix wasabi into a thick consistency</li>
        <li>Add butter to the mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper for taste</li>
        <li>Finally, thoroughly mix in wasabi to preferred liking</li>
    </ol>
